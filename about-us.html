<h1>About Transfusion Drink and how we evaluate beverage claims</h1>

<section id="mission" class="card">
<h2>Our mission: practical guidance for transfusion drink choices</h2>
<p>Transfusion Drink exists to provide clear, evidence-based guidance for people around the world who want to understand what transfusion drinks are, how they work, and whether they are right for their needs. We serve an international audience with diverse backgrounds, activity levels, and health goals.</p>
<p>Our mission is simple: to help you make informed decisions about transfusion energy drink products without overstating benefits or making medical claims. We are not healthcare providers, and we do not prescribe or diagnose. Instead, we translate ingredient labels, nutrition science, and safety guidelines into practical language that supports everyday choices.</p>
<p>Whether you are an athlete looking for hydration support, a traveller managing energy across time zones, or simply curious about what sets a transfusion beverage apart from water or traditional sports drinks, we aim to give you the context you need. We believe that informed consumers make better choices, and that transparency builds trust.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive overview of transfusion drink benefits and ingredients, visit our <a href="/">transfusion drink nutrition overview</a>. If you have specific questions about timing, safety, or product selection, our <a href="/faq">transfusion drink FAQ</a> offers clear answers organised by topic.</p>
</section>

<section id="method" class="card">
<h2>Our method for reviewing transfusion drink nutrition and effects</h2>
<p>We take a label-first, evidence-informed approach to evaluating transfusion drink products. This means we start with what is actually in the bottle—ingredients, quantities, and nutrition facts—rather than marketing claims or anecdotal testimonials.</p>
<p>Our evaluation process prioritises peer-reviewed research, government health guidelines, and established nutrition science. We look at the role of key ingredients such as electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium), B vitamins, caffeine, amino acids, and carbohydrates. We consider how these components interact to support hydration, energy metabolism, and physical performance.</p>
<p>We also assess context: a transfusion energy drink that works well for a marathon runner may not be appropriate for a sedentary office worker or a teenager. We highlight when products contain high levels of caffeine, added sugars, or sodium, and we explain why these factors matter for different user profiles.</p>
<p>Our reviews do not rank or endorse specific brands. Instead, we teach you how to compare products yourself using criteria that align with your goals and health status. We believe this approach empowers you to adapt your choices as your needs change over time.</p>

<section id="sources" class="card">
<h2>Sources we trust and how we cite them</h2>
<p>We prioritise authoritative, peer-reviewed, and publicly accessible sources when researching transfusion drink ingredients, nutrition science, and safety guidelines. Our preference is for government health agencies, academic institutions, international health organisations, and established medical references.</p>
<p>We regularly consult resources such as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Bookshelf</a>, the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/nutrition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization nutrition guidance</a>, and evidence-based medicine frameworks documented in sources like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia's evidence-based medicine overview</a>.</p>
<p>When we reference a study, guideline, or fact sheet, we link directly to the source so you can verify the information yourself. We avoid relying on commercial websites, brand-sponsored research, or sources with undisclosed conflicts of interest unless we explicitly note the limitation.</p>
<p>We also recognise that nutrition science evolves. Recommendations about caffeine intake, electrolyte balance, and hydration strategies are updated as new research emerges. We commit to reviewing our content regularly to reflect current best practices.</p>
